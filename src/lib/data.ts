      'Ever since I was a little kid, game development has been my passion. I was always obsessed with knowing what is the logic behind all these worlds, I remember sitting down and disarming Mario64, to see what was inside the cartridge. With all this I discovered a great passion for Software development, because it allowed me to create those unrealistic places, where I spent so much hours. That is why I am currently studying video game development in different video game engines such as Unity or Unreal Engine.',
